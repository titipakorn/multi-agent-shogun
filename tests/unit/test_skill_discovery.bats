# Regression test for per-agent skill folder layout (2026-06-16).
# Verifies:
#   1. The 8 migrated shogun skills live under skills/shogun/<skill>/.
#   2. SKILL.md name: fields lack the shogun- prefix.
#   3. 8 role folders exist: common + orchestrator + 7 specialists.
#   4. Each specialist instruction file has an "## Available Skills" section.
#   5. skill-creator remains at top level (universal).
#   6. Zero stale shogun-<skill> references in user-facing docs.
#   7. No legacy skills/shogun-* directories remain.
