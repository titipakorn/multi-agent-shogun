    they know the system appears unresponsive.

    Source of truth: queue/inbox/shogun.yaml. This is the file that
    scripts/inbox_write.sh writes to when the Telegram listener forwards a
    Lord message, and that Shogun flips `read: True` on when it picks the
    message up. Both transitions are script-driven and deterministic — unlike

    maintain), so we can rely on the inbox file's read state for paging.

    Idempotent: each (id, timestamp) pair warns at most once per listener
    lifetime. The `warned_entries` set (caller-owned) tracks what we've
    already paged about. Entries that disappear from the file or that flip
    to read: True are pruned from the set so the memory doesn't grow
    unboundedly across long uptimes.
